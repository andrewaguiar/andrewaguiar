I've been working as a software developer for 14 years, working with java desktop (swing), java web, ruby, javascript and most recently with elixir.

I worked as a java and java web instructor at caelum for 4 years and since jan 2018 i am also co-owner at digaxisapp (a side project with some friends).

Currently I've just finished a sabbatical pause in which i focused on my family and resting and now i am looking for a new opportunity as software developer (ruby or elixir) + javascript.
